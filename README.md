# BlockBreaker

A 2D game made in Unity made by following the course  Complete C# Unity Game Developer 2D made by GameDev.tv

This game is inspired by the classic DX-Ball. While creating this I learned all the basics in Unity 2D.

A visual representation of the game can be seen in the attached link. (I dare you to get to the 5th lvl)
